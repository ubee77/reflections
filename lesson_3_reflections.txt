When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when im working with others on a single project, or when i might need to work from different computers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might want to work on 1 perticular branch, git would pull everything, if set to pull 
automatically. 
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branch allows the simultaneous development of code/files in more than 1 logical aspects (like adding of
more than 1 features), or by more than 1 users in a single repository.
clone copies the entire repository either from a given URL or from the path of some other local 
repository onto a newly created repository in the local computer.
fork copies the entire repositry on the github servers onto a newly created repository on the github server itself.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
fast forward merge is possible, as only then we get a structure where we might need to 
merge a commmit into one of its anscestors, as the stored last copy would be either the 
ancestor or the node itself(just after a git fetch). even otherwise, during fetch, git 
needs to copy to local repository, only a the new commits. Otherwise, it would have had 
to copy everything, to implement storing entire version.

got it!
if we are in out of sync or behind state, we cannot push. we need to fetch and merge first
or pull. then push.
