When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when im working with others on a single project, or when i might need to work from different computers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might want to work on 1 perticular branch, git would pull everything, if set to pull 
automatically. 
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branch allows the simultaneous development of code/files in more than 1 logical aspects (like adding of
more than 1 features), or by more than 1 users in a single repository.
clone copies the entire repository either from a given URL or from the path of some other local 
repository onto a newly created repository in the local computer.
fork copies the entire repositry on the github servers onto a newly created repository on the github server itself.
