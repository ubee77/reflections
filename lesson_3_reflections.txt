When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when im working with others on a single project, or when i might need to work from different computers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might want to work on 1 perticular branch, git would pull everything, if set to pull 
automatically.
