What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
when we initialise a repository, a folder named .git is created first.
It is hidden by default, in most file explorers. it does not have any 
commit or screenshot of any version of the files in that directory. 
They are in a untracked state. git knows, the files exist, but that 
they are not being tracked at present. Their history of versions is not 
recorded by git yet.
To apply version control to a directory, that is, to keep a record of
its versions here onwards, a git repository is initialized.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area has files added to it from w.d. if commit command 
is given screen shot of staging are is saved to repsitory. files, 
once put onto the staging area, thay there until explicitly removed.
there after, whenever commit is used, version of all files in staging area is saved.
